### Tanks ###
Move radios to their own slot
Perhaps categorize special modules e.g. maintenance, weapons, armour, misc
Amphibious Drive? #Shelved for now
Reexamine experimental tank chassis
Look at max speeds for heavy armour, also fuel consumption, apc stats and breakthrough

### Ships ###
Battleship hull changes?
Look into more electronics on ships
Finally fix all ship priorities
Change aerial mine warfare (aerial minesweeping before 1980?)

### Aircraft ###
Maybe edit the stats of ASW heli vs CAS CV
Maybe edit land air wing sizes too?

### Misc ###
Japanese ship namelists (and that one division name)
Rebalance terrain movement?
Fix Japanese tank designer GFX
Look into improving air supply
