### Overall objectives ###
Strengthen armoured units from their underpowered state in base TNO
Fix various annoying bugs and behaviours that break immersion/make combat less satisfying
Make more obscure tech more rewarding e.g. flamethrower companies, heavy tanks and nuclear engines
Overall provide a more balanced, flexible and immersive warfare experience for large-scale wars e.g. 2WRW, GAW and WW3

### Doctrines ###
Allow simultaneous Naval/Air integration in Combined Arms

### Tanks ###
3 Extra Modules on Armoured Vehicles, unlocked at 1950, 1960 and 1970 Chassis
Superheavies can have multiple secondary turrets, heavy tanks may also have up to 2
Rebalanced Chassis #Done for AC, APC, AFC, MBT, Heavy and Superheavy - Kugelpanzer and Experimental chassis are TBC
Rebalanced Modules #Currently only for regular, TBC for experimental modules

### Ships ###
Buff nuclear ship engines
Secondary armaments can instead be AA guns #But not SAMs; I want to incentivize researching both systems
Removed the large carrier deck space modules for a fairer and more realistic carrier game #Planes got bigger after WW2
Ballistic missiles can now be put on submarines
Sonar and Radar simultaneously

### Aircraft ###
Make Aircav a line battalion again
Balance Aircav e.g. weaker in forest/jungle vs elite inf (and make them very fast everywhere) #Done movement, but needs rexamining
Modify historic division templates accordingly #Done for playable scenarios, maybe look into doing it for all tags
Naval helicopters carrier capable
Change carrier air wing sizes from 10 to 20, for ease of management on large fleets
Carrier overstacking penalties reduced

### Misc ###
Fix Naval terrain penalties for small screens #Might want to change display order though
Restore infrastructure balance back to vanilla levels
Fixed blank GFX for flame tank companies #Currently just a generic AFV/MBT sprite but it's better than no GFX at all
Nerf rifle piercing values #That's what rocket launchers are for!
Nerf infantry AA to shred CAS a bit less #That's what MANPADs and towed AA are for!
Reduced frequency of ace generation
PARADROPS!!!
Improved Japanese div and capital ship namelists #Still need to do screens 
Small fuel capacity bonus from logistic companies #Improved logistics shouldn't hold back an infantry template so much now
Leg infantry speed bonus from log companies #Less to carry on their backs
Small recon bonus from signal companies #Better communications = better recon, right?
